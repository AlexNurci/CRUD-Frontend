# CRUD Frontend

This project uses React and React-Router to display a Single-Page App. It is useful as a starting point for the Create-Read-Update-Delete project.

## Getting Started

This app works best in conjunction with the CRUD-Backend starting point repository. Go to that repo and get it up and running so that this Frontend has an API to request data from.

With that done, run the following commands:

1. Clone or fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Install the NPM packages: `npm install`
3. Preview your React app: `npm run start-dev`

You should be able to deploy this application to Vercel by simply connecting the GitHub repo to a new Vercel project.
